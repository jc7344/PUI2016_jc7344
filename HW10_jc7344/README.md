## Homework 10

### Assignment 1

For this assignment I completed the notebook along with Dr. Sina Kashuk. I worked closely with Alexey and Nonie. I had a several problems with my kernel when attempting to load my data so in one case I chose the path straight to professor Bianco’s repository. 

### Assignment 2

Assignment_2

For this assignment I worked closely with Alexey. We performed Global autocorrelation analysis for summer **(0.64335490815356511, 4220.5552980795601)** and for winter **(0.66023249858156818, 1600.8324238675889)**. Additionally, we followed Dr. Kashuk’s instructions and learnt that Moran’s I measures the global spatial autocorrelation. For this reason, we conclude that  I statistic for summer rides was 0.643 and for winter is 0.660. I statistics is not close to our expected value for summer rides and winter rides. 

**Results for Local autocorrelation with hot and cold spots:**

•	Number of Hotspots_summer: 190 Number of Coldspots_summer: 242

•	Number of Hotspots_winter: 193 Number of Coldspots_winter: 211
