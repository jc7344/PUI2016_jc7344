## Assignment 1

For this assignment I divided my time in two portions. The first part I covered with Nonie Mathur. We identified the data needed to perform the analysis and studied the variables contained on them. However, we encountered some difficulties when analyzing the number of Community districts present in the different datasets. We first obtained the data from Bytes of the Big City and then we realized we had to download it from the course website. 

The second portion of the assignment I worked remotely with the help of Kristin Korsberg. She was crucial in understanding the different parts of the analysis. From creating the indicators, to concatenate and harmonize the resulting data. 

## Assignment 2

For this assignment I carefully reviewed Kevin Han and Victor Setteâ€™s visualizations. I read a couple of peer reviews to identify both the tone of the document and the kind of suggestions I should make as a result of the assessment.
