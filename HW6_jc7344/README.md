For this Assignment Alexey, Laura, Nonie and Misha incorporated the suggestions from our different peer reviewers. We transformed both our original Null and Alternative Hypotheses in order to include a comparison between the means of the sample and the total population. We used a z-test to establish the comparison and we could reject our Null Hypothesis. 

The base for our Authorea document was a combination of Alexey’s, Laura’s and my own notebook.  All team members collaborated on the write-up.
