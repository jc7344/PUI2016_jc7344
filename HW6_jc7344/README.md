## Homework 6
## Assigment 1
For this assignment I worked with Nonie, Laura, Alexey and Kristi. I started by following Professor Federica’s skeleton Notebook’s instructions. However, I encountered problems when opening the downloaded data from compute. 
I decided to email professor Federica and her instructions were really helpful both for assignment 2 and for my own study guide. For the last parts of the assignment **Kristi Korsberg** and I worked really closely. She was instrumental for plotting all merged data and for fitting a line and a second degree polynomial to the data. We also decided, for the Chi square portion, to create lists instead of using arrays. 


### Assignment 2

For this Assignment Alexey, Laura, Nonie and Misha incorporated the suggestions from our different peer reviewers. We transformed both our original Null and Alternative Hypotheses in order to include a comparison between the means of the sample and the total population. We used a z-test to establish the comparison and we could reject our Null Hypothesis. 

The base for our Authorea document was a combination of Alexey’s, Laura’s and my own notebook.  All team members collaborated on the write-up.
