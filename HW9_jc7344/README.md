# Homework 9

## Tasks 1, 2 and 3

For this homework I worked with Alexey, Laura Gladson, Nonie Mathur and Kristi Krosberg. I manipulated the data according to Professor Bianco’s instructions and established the assumptions needed regarding discrepancies in the number of weeks between May 21, 2010 and February 21, 2012, we concluded that the event that produced such low ridership levels was Hurricane Sandy. I tried to include actual documentation regarding the natural disaster but I was not able to insert the .png file in my Jupyter Notebook.

For tasks 2 and 3 I received valuable instructions form Kristi. Her guidance was crucial both in reducing the provided data and in identifying the 4 stations with the most prominent periodic trend on a 52-week period. 

Finally, and following Professor Bianco’s suggestions, I am posting documentation on Huracaine Sandy below.
