##Homework 5

##Assignment 1

For this assignment I worked closely with Laura Gladson, Kristin Korsberg and Nonie Mathur. Laura was instrumental for applying the KS test and Kristin’s guidance was really helpful for understanding the nature of Anderson Darling test.




##Assignment 2

For this assignment I worked closely with Nonie Mathur, Kristin Korsberg and Laura Gladson. I encountered several obstacles when attempting to do the last three parts of the assignment. I decided submit about 70% of assignment 2 and leave out the portion that I did was not able to complete. 

I will have to go over the materials for this session again when preparing for the midterm. I did not think copy-pasting was the honest path to take, especially if I was not understanding completely what I was doing. All coding displayed on this notebook was adapted from Professor Federica’s skeleton notebook and some contributions of my own creation. 
 


## Assignment 3
##Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Do American trust the president? POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.


• Null: The average fat loss for both people who exercise and people who diet is the same. The difference between the to averages equals zero.

Average FatLossDiet - Average FatlLossExercise = 0

• Null: There is not clear leading opinion among surveyed population, both followers and opponents are evenly distributed.

%followers = %opponents

• Null: The cessation rates of peopleusing nicotine patches for quitting cigarettes is the same or lower than the proportion of people using placebo patches.

NicotinePUsers/PeopleQuitting <= PlaceboUsers/ PeopleQuitting

• Null: The mean of the IQ results for children whose mothers smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day during pregnancy are the same as the mean scores for those whose mothers do not smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day.

MeanIQSmoker = MeanIQNonSmoker
